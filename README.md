# Pathfinder

This beatiful project was made by me and my friend [David Lukeny]("https://github.com/Davluk") for our Machine Learning Signature. 

The program is capable to learn how to find a path through a labyrinth with a genetic algorithm.

The file AG.js contains the flow of the genetic algorithm in general, the file GA_functions.js contains all the methods and operators that the algorithm uses, and the file index.html contains the layout of the page and all of the front end stuff.
